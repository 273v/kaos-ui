"""Helpers for kaos-agents-on-FastAPI apps.

Promotes the workarounds the `single-user-chat` example carried into
reusable helpers, so every kaos-agents-on-FastAPI app doesn't have to
re-invent them.

The workarounds compensate for two known kaos-agents 0.1.0a1
defaults that bit us during the chat-app build:

- ``create_app(runtime=None)`` defaults to an **in-memory** VFS (silent
  data loss across restarts) — :func:`build_chat_runtime` returns a
  disk-backed ``KaosRuntime`` so the caller's ``create_agent_app(runtime=...)``
  always persists.
- ``Runner`` skips creating a ``KaosContext`` when ``corpus`` is None,
  so bridged tools fail at execution with "No runtime context."
  :func:`install_tool_bridge_runtime_patch` idempotently patches
  ``kaos_agents.actions.tool_bridge.bridge_runtime_tools`` to thread
  ``KaosContext.create(runtime=runtime)`` when one isn't supplied.

:func:`augment_instructions` prepends the date preamble (Claude-class
models confidently hallucinate the year otherwise) and a
tools-disabled directive when applicable. It no longer inlines a
tool catalog — kaos-agents 0.1.0a5+ routes bridged tools through
kaos-llm-core's ReAct, which passes them to the LLM via the
provider's native tool-use API (``tools=``), so the catalog reaches
the model regardless of whether it appears in the system prompt.
See ``kaos-modules/docs/plans/thin-worker-prompt.md`` §4.5 (M5)
for the verification trail.

See `examples/single-user-chat/docs/UPSTREAM-NOTES.md` for the matching
upstream tickets.
